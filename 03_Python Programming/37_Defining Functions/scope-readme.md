## Overview
Scope in Python refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of a program. Understanding scope is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and bug-free code. Python follows the LEGB rule for scope resolution.

## Key Concepts

1. **LEGB Rule:**
   - Local (L): Variables defined within a function
   - Enclosing (E): Variables in the local scope of enclosing functions
   - Global (G): Variables defined at the top level of a module or declared global
   - Built-in (B): Names preassigned in Python (like print, len)

2. **Local Scope:**
   - Variables defined within a function
   - Accessible only within that function
   - Created when the function is called and destroyed when it returns

3. **Enclosing Scope:**
   - Relevant for nested functions
   - Outer function's local scope is the enclosing scope for the inner function

4. **Global Scope:**
   - Variables defined at the top level of a module
   - Accessible throughout the module

5. **Built-in Scope:**
   - Names that are pre-defined in Python
   - Always accessible unless explicitly overridden

6. **The `global` Keyword:**
   - Used to declare that a variable inside a function is global
   - Allows modification of global variables from within functions

7. **The `nonlocal` Keyword:**
   - Used in nested functions to refer to variables in the enclosing (non-global) scope
   - Allows modification of variables in the enclosing scope

8. **Name Resolution:**
   - Python looks for a variable name in the order: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in

## Best Practices

1. Minimize the use of global variables
2. Use function parameters and return values instead of relying on global state
3. Be explicit about scope using `global` and `nonlocal` when necessary
4. Avoid shadowing built-in names
5. Keep functions small and focused to minimize scope complexity

## Common Pitfalls

1. Unintentionally creating local variables when intending to use global ones
2. Overusing global variables, leading to unclear data flow
3. Naming conflicts between local and global variables
4. Forgetting to use `nonlocal` in nested functions when modifying enclosing scope variables

## Conclusion

Understanding scope in Python is essential for writing maintainable and error-free code. Proper use of scope helps in creating modular programs, avoiding naming conflicts, and managing the flow of data within your application. By mastering the concepts of local, enclosing, global, and built-in scopes, along with the proper use of `global` and `nonlocal` keywords, you can write more efficient and organized Python code.
