# Python map() Function

The `map()` function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and returns a map object.

## Syntax:
```python
map(function, iterable, ...)
```

## Key Features:
- Applies a function to every item in the input iterable(s).
- Returns a map object, which is an iterator.
- Can be used with built-in functions, lambda functions, or user-defined functions.
- Can take multiple iterables as arguments if the function has multiple parameters.

## Common Operations:
- Creating a map object: `map(function, iterable)`
- Converting map object to list: `list(map_object)`
- Using with lambda functions: `map(lambda x: x*2, iterable)`
- Using with multiple iterables: `map(function, iterable1, iterable2)`

## Use Cases:
- Applying a transformation to all elements in a sequence
- Performing element-wise operations on multiple sequences
- Parsing or converting data types in a sequence
