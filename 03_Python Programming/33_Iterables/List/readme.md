# Python Lists

A list in Python is an ordered, mutable sequence of elements. Lists can contain elements of different types, including other lists.

## Key Features:
- Ordered: Elements in a list have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- Mutable: Lists can be modified after creation (add, remove, or change elements).
- Allow Duplicates: You can have multiple identical elements in a list.
- Indexed: Elements can be accessed by their position in the list.

## Common Operations:
- Creation: `[]` or `list()`
- Append element: `append()`
- Insert element: `insert()`
- Remove element: `remove()` or `pop()`
- Access element: Using index `list[index]`
- Slicing: `list[start:end]`
- List comprehension: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`

## Use Cases:
- Storing and manipulating sequences of data
- Implementing stacks and queues
- Keeping track of ordered items
