# Iterable Strings in Python

In Python, strings are sequences of characters and are iterable. This means you can loop over a string to access its individual characters.

## Key Features:
- Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters.
- Each character in a string can be accessed by its index.
- Strings support slicing operations.
- You can iterate over a string using a for loop.

## Common Operations:
- Accessing characters: `string[index]`
- Slicing: `string[start:end:step]`
    - Key Slicing Notation:
    [start:stop:step] is the general form of slicing.
    start: The index to begin the slice (inclusive).
    stop: The index to stop the slice (exclusive).
    step: The stride or step value (default is 1 for forward movement).
- Iteration: `for char in string:`
- String methods: `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `split()`, etc.



## Use Cases:
- Text processing
- Data parsing
- Input validation
- Character-by-character analysis
