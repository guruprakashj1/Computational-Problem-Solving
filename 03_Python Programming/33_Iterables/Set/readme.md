# Python Sets

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable, but the elements themselves must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples).

## Key Features:
- Unordered: Elements in a set do not have a specific order.
- Unique Elements: Duplicates are automatically removed.
- Mutable: The set itself can be modified (add or remove elements).
- Elements must be immutable: You can't have lists or dictionaries as set elements.

## Common Operations:
- Creation: `set()` or `{element1, element2, ...}`
- Add element: `add()`
- Remove element: `remove()` or `discard()`
- Set operations: union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`), symmetric difference (`^`)

## Use Cases:
- Removing duplicates from a collection
- Membership testing
- Mathematical set operations
