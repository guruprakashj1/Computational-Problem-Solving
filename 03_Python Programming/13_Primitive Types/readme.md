# 2- Primitive Types in Python

## Introduction
Primitive types, also known as built-in types, are the most basic data types available in Python. They are the building blocks for data manipulation and serve as the foundation for more complex data structures. Understanding primitive types is crucial for any Python programmer.

## Main Primitive Types in Python

1. **Integers (int)**
   - Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals
   - Example: 5, -3, 0

2. **Floating-point numbers (float)**
   - Numbers with decimal points
   - Example: 3.14, -0.5, 2.0

3. **Strings (str)**
   - Sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes
   - Example: "Hello", 'Python', "123"

4. **Booleans (bool)**
   - Represents True or False values
   - Used for logical operations and control flow

5. **NoneType**
   - Represents the absence of a value or a null value
   - Only has one value: None

## Type Conversion
Python allows you to convert between different primitive types using built-in functions:
- `int()`: Converts to integer
- `float()`: Converts to float
- `str()`: Converts to string
- `bool()`: Converts to boolean

## Type Checking
You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.

## Conclusion
Understanding primitive types is essential for writing efficient and error-free Python code. These basic types form the foundation for more complex data structures and operations in Python programming.
