# Question 1: Temperature Monitor
# Create a function called monitor_temperature that simulates a temperature monitoring system.
# The function should continuously prompt the user for temperature readings (in Celsius).
# If the temperature exceeds 100Â°C, print a warning message.
# The monitoring should continue until the user enters 'q' to quit.
# Keep track of the number of readings taken and display it when the program ends.

# Hint: Use an infinite loop with a break condition. Use try-except to handle non-numeric inputs.

def monitor_temperature():
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your function
# monitor_temperature()


# Question 2: Number Guessing Game
# Create a function called number_guessing_game that generates a random number between 1 and 100,
# and then enters an infinite loop where the user tries to guess the number.
# Provide "too high" or "too low" feedback for each guess.
# The game should continue until the user guesses correctly or enters 'q' to quit.
# Display the number of attempts when the game ends.

# Hint: Use the random module to generate a number. Use an infinite loop with break conditions for correct guess or quit.

import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your function
# number_guessing_game()


# Question 3: Simple Calculator
# Create a function called calculator that implements a simple calculator using an infinite loop.
# The calculator should repeatedly prompt the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /).
# Perform the calculation and display the result.
# The calculator should continue running until the user enters 'q' to quit.
# Handle potential errors like division by zero.

# Hint: Use an infinite loop with a break condition for quitting. Use a dictionary to map operations to functions.

def calculator():
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your function
# calculator()
