# Print if a given number is ODD or EVEN

This README file provides a step-by-step procedure to determine whether a given number is odd or even.

## Problem Statement

Given a number, determine if it is odd or even and print the result.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Start with the given number.

2. Divide the number by 2.

3. Check if there is a remainder after the division:
   - If there is no remainder (the result is a whole number), the original number is even.
   - If there is a remainder, the original number is odd.

4. Print the result:
   - If the number is even, print "EVEN"
   - If the number is odd, print "ODD"

## Explanation

- Even numbers are integers that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder.
- Odd numbers are integers that, when divided by 2, always have a remainder of 1.
- The division by 2 and checking for a remainder is the fundamental method to distinguish between odd and even numbers.

## Example

Let's say the given number is 7:

1. Start with 7.
2. Divide 7 by 2: 7 รท 2 = 3 remainder 1
3. There is a remainder (1), so 7 is odd.
4. Print "ODD"

This procedure works for any integer, positive or negative.
