# Find the SUM of given two numbers

This README file provides a step-by-step procedure to calculate the sum of two given numbers.

## Problem Statement

Given two numbers, calculate their sum and report the result.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Start with the two given numbers.

2. Add the two numbers together:
   - Combine the value of the first number with the value of the second number.

3. The result of this addition is the sum.

4. Report the sum as the final result.

## Explanation

- Addition is the process of combining two or more quantities into a single quantity.
- The sum is the result of this addition operation.
- In mathematical notation, we use the '+' symbol to represent addition.
- The order of the numbers doesn't matter in addition (this is known as the commutative property of addition).

## Examples

1. Let's say the given numbers are 5 and 3:
   - Start with 5 and 3
   - Add them together: 5 + 3 = 8
   - Report the sum: 8

2. If the given numbers are -2 and 7:
   - Start with -2 and 7
   - Add them together: -2 + 7 = 5
   - Report the sum: 5

3. If the given numbers are 3.5 and 2.7:
   - Start with 3.5 and 2.7
   - Add them together: 3.5 + 2.7 = 6.2
   - Report the sum: 6.2

This procedure works for any two real numbers, including positive numbers, negative numbers, integers, and decimal numbers.

## Note

- When adding large numbers, it's often helpful to align the numbers vertically by their place values (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.) before adding.
- When adding decimal numbers, ensure that the decimal points are aligned vertically before adding.
- In programming, be aware of the limitations of numeric data types to avoid overflow errors when adding very large numbers.
