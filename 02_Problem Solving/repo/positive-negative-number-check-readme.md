# Find if a given number is positive or negative

This README file provides a step-by-step procedure to determine whether a given number is positive or negative.

## Problem Statement

Given a number, determine if it is positive or negative and report the result.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Start with the given number.

2. Compare the number to zero:
   - If the number is greater than zero, it is positive.
   - If the number is less than zero, it is negative.
   - If the number is equal to zero, it is neither positive nor negative (it's zero).

3. Report the result:
   - If the number is positive, report "POSITIVE"
   - If the number is negative, report "NEGATIVE"
   - If the number is zero, report "ZERO"

## Explanation

- Positive numbers are greater than zero and are located to the right of zero on a number line.
- Negative numbers are less than zero and are located to the left of zero on a number line.
- Zero is neither positive nor negative; it's the point that separates positive and negative numbers on the number line.

## Examples

1. Let's say the given number is 5:
   - 5 is greater than 0, so it's positive.
   - Report "POSITIVE"

2. If the given number is -3:
   - -3 is less than 0, so it's negative.
   - Report "NEGATIVE"

3. If the given number is 0:
   - 0 is neither greater than nor less than itself.
   - Report "ZERO"

This procedure works for any real number, including integers and decimal numbers.

## Note

In some contexts, zero is considered to be non-negative (i.e., either positive or zero). If this is the case for your specific application, you may want to adjust the procedure to report zero as "NON-NEGATIVE" instead of "ZERO".
