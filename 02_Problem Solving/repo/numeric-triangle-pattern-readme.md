# Print the Numeric Triangle Pattern

This README file provides a step-by-step procedure to print the triangle pattern of numbers as shown in the image.

## Problem Statement

Print a pattern of numbers that forms a right-angled triangle, where each row starts with 1 and increases sequentially, with the number of digits in each row equal to the row number.

## Pattern Description

The pattern looks like this:
```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Determine the number of rows for the pattern (in this case, it's 5).

2. Create an outer loop that iterates from 1 to the number of rows (inclusive).

3. For each iteration of the outer loop:
   a. Create an inner loop that iterates from 1 to the current row number.
   b. In each iteration of the inner loop, print the current number followed by a space.
   c. After the inner loop completes, print a newline character to move to the next line.

4. Repeat steps 3a-3c until all rows are printed.

## Explanation

- The outer loop controls the number of rows.
- The inner loop prints the numbers for each row, starting from 1 up to the current row number.
- We print a space after each number to separate them horizontally.
- The newline character after each row of numbers ensures each row starts on a new line.

## Pseudocode

```
n = 5  // Number of rows

for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 1 to i:
        print j followed by a space
    print newline
```

## Note

- This pattern is a variation of the classic triangle pattern, using sequential numbers instead of repeating symbols.
- The number of rows can be easily modified by changing the value of n.
- Make sure to handle any language-specific syntax for loops and print statements when implementing this in a specific programming language.
- In some languages, you might need to use string concatenation or formatting to achieve the same result.
- The spacing between numbers is important for readability, as shown in the image.

## Variations

You can create variations of this pattern by:
1. Aligning the triangle to the right side.
2. Using different starting numbers or increment values.
3. Creating an inverted triangle by starting with the maximum number of digits and decreasing.

These variations can be achieved by modifying the loop conditions and the printed values.
