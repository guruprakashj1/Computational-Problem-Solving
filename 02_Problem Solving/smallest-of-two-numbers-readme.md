# Find the smallest of the given two numbers

This README file provides a step-by-step procedure to determine the smallest of two given numbers.

## Problem Statement

Given two numbers, find and report which one is the smallest (or if they are equal).

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Start with the two given numbers, let's call them a and b.

2. Compare a and b:
   - If a is less than b, a is the smallest.
   - If b is less than a, b is the smallest.
   - If a is equal to b, they are the same (equal).

3. Report the result:
   - If a is the smallest, report "a is the smallest" (replace 'a' with the actual number).
   - If b is the smallest, report "b is the smallest" (replace 'b' with the actual number).
   - If they are equal, report "The numbers are equal".

## Explanation

- This method uses a simple comparison operation to determine which number is smaller.
- The comparison takes into account the possibility that the numbers might be equal.
- This works for any real numbers, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.

## Examples

1. Let's say the given numbers are 5 and 3:
   - Compare 5 and 3
   - 3 is less than 5
   - Report: "3 is the smallest"

2. If the given numbers are -2 and 7:
   - Compare -2 and 7
   - -2 is less than 7
   - Report: "-2 is the smallest"

3. If the given numbers are 4.5 and 4.5:
   - Compare 4.5 and 4.5
   - They are equal
   - Report: "The numbers are equal"

This procedure works for any two real numbers, including integers and decimal numbers.

## Note

- When implementing this in a programming language, be aware of the data types you're using. Some languages have different comparison behaviors for integers vs. floating-point numbers.
- For very large numbers or very precise decimal numbers, be mindful of the limitations of your programming language or system's number representation to avoid precision errors.
- In some programming contexts, you might want to return the smaller number itself rather than a descriptive string. Adjust the reporting step as needed for your specific use case.
- This operation is the inverse of finding the largest number. In many programming languages, you can use the same comparison operator and just switch the logic (e.g., change > to <).
