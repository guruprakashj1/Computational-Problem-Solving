# Special Code Generator

## Problem Description

You are tasked with generating a special "code" that consists of three parts:

1. **Two-digit number**:
   * The number must be **odd** and between **10 and 99**.
   * Numbers divisible by 5 should be skipped.

2. **One-digit number**:
   * This number must be **greater than 5** and less than 10.
   * The number will be obtained using a **while loop**.

3. **Month**:
   * You will select a **month** from a list of all months.
   * Only months starting with the letter **'J'** (January, June, July) can be chosen.

After generating a valid two-digit number, one-digit number, and month, the **code** is created by combining them as a string in the format:

```
two_digit_number-one_digit_number-month
```

## Concepts Covered

This program helps to demonstrate:

* **For loops**: Iterating over two-digit numbers.
* **While loops**: Finding the one-digit number within the specified range.
* **Nested loops**: Selecting a month that starts with the letter 'J'.
* **If-elif-else decision making**: Checking odd/even conditions, divisibility by 5, and month name conditions.

## Solution

Here's an outline of the solution:

1. Use a **for loop** to iterate over all two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99) and:
   * Check if the number is **odd**.
   * Skip numbers that are divisible by 5 using `continue`.

2. Inside the for loop, use a **while loop** to generate a **one-digit number** that is:
   * Greater than 5 and less than 10.

3. In a nested loop, iterate over the list of months to find a month that starts with **'J'**.

4. Once valid values are found, **concatenate** the two-digit number, one-digit number, and month to generate a **special code** in the following format:

```
two_digit_number-one_digit_number-month
```

## Sample Code

```python
import random

# Step 1: Iterate over two-digit odd numbers using a for loop
for two_digit in range(10, 100):
    if two_digit % 2 != 0:  # Check if odd
        if two_digit % 5 == 0:
            continue  # Skip numbers divisible by 5
        print(f"Selected two-digit number: {two_digit}")

        # Step 2: Use a while loop to get a one-digit number between 6 and 9
        one_digit = 6  # Start with 6
        while one_digit < 10:
            print(f"Selected one-digit number: {one_digit}")

            # Step 3: Check for a month that starts with 'J'
            months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
            for month in months:
                if month.startswith('J'):
                    print(f"Selected month: {month}")

                    # Step 4: Combine the numbers and month into a code
                    code = f"{two_digit}-{one_digit}-{month}"
                    print(f"Generated code: {code}")
                    break  # Exit month loop once valid month found
            break  # Exit while loop after valid one-digit number found
        break  # Exit for loop after valid two-digit number found
```

## Learning Objectives

By solving this problem, you will:

* Practice working with **for loops** and **while loops**.
* Understand how to use **nested loops** and make conditional decisions using **if-elif-else**.
* Learn how to manipulate strings and numbers for output formatting.

## Execution

* When you run the code, it will first find an odd two-digit number that is not divisible by 5.
* Then, a one-digit number between 6 and 9 will be selected.
* Finally, the code will select a month that starts with 'J' from a predefined list.
* The generated code will be printed in the format: `two_digit_number-one_digit_number-month`.
